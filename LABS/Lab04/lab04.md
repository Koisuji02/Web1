# Lab 4: Getting Started with HTML and CSS 
In this lab, you create a first version of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for your chosen exam topic using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

Remember, you're only designing the look and feel of the application, in this lab, without implementing any functions. Since you do not have access to a database, fill the webpage with a few made-up items. 

1\.  Implement a web-based GUI of your web app. 

Develop a static webpage to display the list of relevant items of your chosen exam topic. Use the Bootstrap framework[^1] to structure and format the graphical components. Follow the requirements defined in your chosen exam topic and complete at least one page of the app that is relevant to your chosen exam topic, avoiding pages that contain user inputs. 

**Notes:** 

1. You can verify you have written a correct HTML page using the W3C validator: <https://validator.w3.org/> 
1. In addition to the use of Bootstrap, feel free to create a separate CSS file to customize the appearance of your website. 
1. You can find several icons on the Bootstrap Icons site (<https://icons.getbootstrap.com>). Specifically, after selecting an icon, you can follow one of these approaches: 
1. Importing the bootstrap icons CSS: 
1. In your web page's header, add the link to the Bootstrap icon’s stylesheet that you can find here: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/#install 
1. Include the icons in your web page using the icon tag: 

   <i class="selected\_icon\_name\_here"></i> 

2. Importing its HTML: 
   1. Copy and paste the HTML section of the icon into your HTML page. 
2. Download the icon: 

i.  After saving the icon (inside the folder of your project), import it using the image 

tag: <img src="path" width="x" height="y">
